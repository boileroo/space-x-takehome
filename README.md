# SpaceX App

This is a create React application that consumes data from the SpaceX public API. The application retrieves historic and future SpaceX launches and presents them in a list view.

The API documentation is available from:
Postman - [https://docs.spacexdata.com](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
GitHub - [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

## Running the App

- Install the required packages using: <code>'npm install'</code>
- Run the app using: <code>'npm run start'</code>

## Potential future improvements

In no particular order:

- Add unit tests where they would add value.
- Consider converting to typescript!
- Consider adding prop type checking using prop-types for input prop validation.
- Consider accessibility e.g. A11Y.
- Pagination of launch list.
